0.  How many different colors does each format support?
    - BMP: 32 bits
    - GIF: 8 bits; 256 different colors
    - JPEG: 24 bits per pixel. 8 bits each for red, green, and blue.
        This gives 16 million possible colors.
    - PNG: 24 bits
    
1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
    - GIF
    
2.  What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
	- With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally
	in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.
	- Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information,
	especially redundant information.
	    
3.  Which of these formats is lossy compressed?
	- JPEG
	
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT(File Allocation Table) file system?
	- When an OS(Operating System) erases a FAT file, two things occur:
		- The system modifies the filename's first character in the file's directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
		- The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
	- This means, that:
		- The actual file data is never touched/'erased'.

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
	- The most common techniques for properly sanitizing hard drives include:
		- Physically destroying the hard drive; making it unusable.
		- Degaussing the drive to randomize the magnetic domains which might make the drive unusable in the process.
		- Overwriting the drive's data so that it cannot be recovered.
	
6.  What's in 'stdint.h'?
	- 'stdint.h' contains a set of typedefs that specify exact-width interger types,together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
 
7.  What's the point of using 'uint8_t', 'uint32_t', 'int32_t', and 'uint16_t' in a program?
	- They precisely define a value in bits. If we want an integer type that's precisely 32 bits long, we can always use a 'long', but for precision, we can use int32_t (or uint32_t) instead.

8.  How many bytes is a 'BYTE', a 'DWORD', a 'LONG', and a 'WORD', respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 appliance) 
	- 'BYTE' = 8 bytes
	- 'DWORD' = 32 bytes
	- 'LONG' = 32 bytes
	- 'WORD' =16 bytes

9.  What (in ASCII, decimal or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
	(Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers").
	- 'Magic numbers' of any BMP files are 0x4D 0X42 (424D)
	
10. What's the difference between 'bfSize' and 'biSize'?
	- bfSize is the size of the whole BMP file: the BMP image + the size of the headers.
	- biSize is the size of the BMP image: size of the RGBTRIPLE + the total size of the padding.

11. What does it mean if 'biHeight' is negative?
	- If the 'biHeight' is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. What field in 'BITMAPINFOHEADER' specifies the BMP's color depth? (i.e bits per pixel)?
	- In the color table.

13. Why might 'fopen' return 'NULL' in 'copy.c:37'?
	-'fopen' might fail even if our program is perfectly correct because we might try to open a file that might not exist or may be write-protected.

14. Why is the third argument to 'fread' always '1' in our code?
	- The third argument to 'fread' is always 1 because we only want to copy or pass 1 element

15. What value does 'copy.c: 70' assign 'paddding' if 'bi.biWidth' is '3'?
	- The value is 0.

16. What does 'fseek' do?
	- 'fseek' sets the file position of the stream (pointer to a FILE object that identifies it) to the given offset (number of bytes to the offset from 'whence', a position from where the offset is added.)

17. What is 'SEEK_CUR'?
	- 'SEEK_CUR' is the current position of the file pointer.

18. Whodunit?
	- Rob Bowden.
